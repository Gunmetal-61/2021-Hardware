2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-54#1 Critical Warning
Scoped false path or clock group constraint between clocks  
A scoped Clock Group timing constraint is set between clocks FFTAudio_Block_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/DRCK and clk_out1_FFTAudio_Block_clk_wiz_1_0 (see constraint position 5 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope. 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#2 Critical Warning
Scoped false path or clock group constraint between clocks  
A scoped Clock Group timing constraint is set between clocks FFTAudio_Block_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/UPDATE and clk_out1_FFTAudio_Block_clk_wiz_1_0 (see constraint position 6 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope. 
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell FFTAudio_Block_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) FFTAudio_Block_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>
