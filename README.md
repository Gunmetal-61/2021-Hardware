My embedded, FPGA, and computer microarchitecture projects of 2021.  This is where I put odd bits and pieces that do not warrant their own repository (yet).

1. [NEORV32 - Arty S7-50 RISC-V FPGA Implementation](#NEORV32-Vivado-Build)
2. [Potato Processor - Arty S7-50 RISC-V FPGA Implementation](#PotatoProcessor-Vivado-Build)
